It's a terrible day in the wastelands,<br>
and you are an angry girl with a bazooka.
</p>

Enough is enough.

The world ended some time ago now, and monsters have turned your home
into a living hell. Day in and day out you fight their hordes, with no
mercy granted and no end in sight. You keep hearing rumors of a
malevolent queen behind the scenes, a vicious puppeteer that plays with
people\'s lives for nothing more than sadistic glee. Staring across the
ruined landscape of humanity\'s fall, you recall the last words you
heard from the last person you ever saw:

<q style="margin-left:40px; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Don't leave fate up to chance...</q>

Let\'s go blow stuff up.

## About

This project was submitted in an unfinished and largely unplayable state
for the GMTK Game Jam 2022. It is currently being rebuilt in an effort
to bring to light all the hard work that went into the project that
never saw the light of day.
